        During internship I enhanced my skills in{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-white">C++, Python, data structures, recursion, and web scraping. </span>
        The experience strengthened my{" "}

        <span className="font-bold text-white">algorithmic thinking</span> to real-world problems, and gave me
         hands-on exposure to{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-white">automation, data handling, and project documentation</span>
      </p>
